# Vibe Security Scan

This bundled optional domain skill provides a defensive appsec scan for AI-assisted codebases. It is adapted from `tanviet12/vbsec` and tuned for Agent Bootstrap projects.

License: MIT, copyright Bui Tan Viet. See `LICENSE.txt`.

## Compatibility Guardrails

- Superpowers remains the workflow authority for planning, TDD, debugging, review, and verification.
- This skill is a security scan playbook, not a workflow skill and not a replacement for Superpowers.
- The core `security-auditor` remains the final independent security gate when the parent task needs review.
- Follow `AGENTS.md`, `.codex/INDEX.md`, `.codex/skills/INDEX.md`, and `.codex/agents/INDEX.md` first.
- Do not attack live systems, bypass authorization, exfiltrate data, or provide weaponized exploit steps.
- Never write secrets, private tokens, cookies, session data, or sensitive user data into reports or vault memory.
- Treat grep matches as leads, not findings. Confirm behavior from code and configuration before reporting.

## When To Use Automatically

Use this skill without waiting for the user to name it when the task touches:

- auth, login, signup, password reset, sessions, OAuth, JWT, cookies, roles, tenant isolation, admin/user permissions
- API routes, server actions, webhooks, backend handlers, Supabase RLS, storage buckets, service role keys
- uploads, file paths, external URLs, SSRF-prone fetch/proxy/import flows
- payment, subscription, quota, reward, order, wallet, or idempotency-sensitive flows
- `.env`, secrets, tokens, keys, logging, error handling, production readiness, dependency/package changes
- CORS, rate limits, brute-force protection, access control, SQL/ORM/raw query code, deserialization, command execution

Do not use this skill for purely visual UI work, copy changes, local-only refactors, or test-only edits unless they touch a security-sensitive boundary.

## Scan Modes

- Focused scan: use when the task touches a narrow surface. Load only the relevant rule files and nearby code.
- Full scan: use when the user asks for a security audit, production readiness review, or broad appsec scan. Load all generic rules, then language overlays for detected languages.
- Large scan: for large repos, read `workflows/large-review-sequential.md` and scan in bounded chunks. Do not create chunks from this skill.

## Language Routing

Always read `references/language-detection.md` for non-trivial scans.

Supported overlays:

- TypeScript/JavaScript: `rules/languages/typescript/`
- Python: `rules/languages/python/`
- PHP: `rules/languages/php/`
- Go: `rules/languages/go/`
- Rust: `rules/languages/rust/`

If no overlay fits, use `rules/generic/`.

## Canonical Rule Set

Use only these canonical rule IDs. If an issue is real but does not fit perfectly, map it to the closest canonical rule instead of inventing a new category.

| # | Rule ID | Max severity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | HARDCODED-SECRET | CRITICAL |
| 2 | SQL-INJECTION | CRITICAL |
| 3 | XSS | HIGH |
| 4 | IDOR | HIGH |
| 5 | SLOPSQUATTING | CRITICAL |
| 6 | BRUTE-FORCE | HIGH |
| 7 | MASS-ASSIGNMENT | CRITICAL |
| 8 | INSECURE-DESERIALIZATION | CRITICAL |
| 9 | SSRF | HIGH |
| 10 | PATH-TRAVERSAL | HIGH |
| 11 | CSRF | HIGH |
| 12 | BROKEN-ACCESS-CONTROL | CRITICAL |
| 13 | WEAK-PASSWORD-HASHING | CRITICAL |
| 14 | JWT-NONE-ALGORITHM | CRITICAL |
| 15 | CORS-MISCONFIG | HIGH |
| 16 | UNRESTRICTED-FILE-UPLOAD | CRITICAL |
| 17 | VERBOSE-ERROR-DEBUG-MODE | HIGH |
| 18 | MISSING-RATE-LIMIT | HIGH |
| 19 | RACE-CONDITION | HIGH |
| 20 | OUTDATED-DEPENDENCY | HIGH |
| 21 | COMMAND-INJECTION | CRITICAL |

## Evidence-First Workflow

1. Confirm the authorized local repo path and requested scope.
2. Map the attack surface: auth, authorization, API/server actions, database access, uploads, external URLs, background jobs, webhooks, dependencies, env/config, logging, and vault-sensitive memory.
3. Detect languages and load the relevant generic rules plus overlays.
4. Search for leads with `rg`, then read surrounding code and data flow before calling anything a finding.
5. Classify data trust using `references/data-flow-classification.md`.
6. Separate confirmed findings from unknowns, assumptions, skipped checks, and false positives.
7. Recommend fixes that preserve controls; never suggest disabling validation, auth, CSRF, rate limits, TLS, RLS, or audit logging as a shortcut.

## Output Contract

Write reports in Vietnamese unless the user asks otherwise.

Start with:

- `KET LUAN: DAT`, `KET LUAN: CAN SUA`, or `KET LUAN: KHONG DAT`
- Severity counts: Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info
- Scope reviewed and scope not reviewed

For each confirmed finding include:

- Severity
- Location
- Evidence
- Impact
- Safe abuse path, without weaponized payloads
- Recommended fix
- Verification step

End with:

- commands run
- files or surfaces reviewed
- unknowns and residual checks
- whether the core `security-auditor` should perform a final independent gate review
